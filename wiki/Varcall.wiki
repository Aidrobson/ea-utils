#summary varcall: highly configurable snp and indel calling tool.

= Introduction =

varcall does two tasks:

 * Calculates error rate statistics in a pileup
 * Outputs variants per position


The tool is not complete.   

In particular: the VCF output is broken, and the error rate calculations should probably be regional, not global.   

One of the advantages is the vast number of parameters, allowing varcall to be used in any situation, this is also a shortcoming... since users must know the meanings of every parameter.

By the time we reach version 1, all of these should be fixed, including better docs, and better "auto-configuration" based on sampling.  If you are using varcall before then, carefully experiment with parameters and compare to other tools.

{{{

Usage: varcall <-s|-v> <-f REF> [options] bam1 [bam2...]
Version: 0.9.1 (BETA)

Either outputs summry stats for the list of files, or performs variant calling

Options (later options override earlier):

-s          Calculate statistics
-v          Calculate variants bases on supplied parameters (see -S)
-f          Reference fasta (required if using bams, ignored otherwise)
-m          Min locii depth (0)
-a          Min allele depth (0)
-p          Min allele pct by quality (0)
-q          Min qual (3)
-Q          Min mapping quality (0)
-b          Min pct balance (strand/total) (0)
-D FLOAT    Max duplicate read fraction (depth/length per position) (1)
-B          Turn off BAQ correction (false)
-R          Homopolymer repeat indel filtering (8)
-e FLOAT    Alpha filter to use, requires -l or -S (.05)
-g FLOAT    Global minimum error rate (default: assume phred is ok)
-l INT      Number of locii in total pileup used for bonferroni (1 mil)
-x CHR:POS  Output this pos only, then quit
-N FIL      Output noise stats to FIL
-S FIL      Read in statistics and params from a previous run with -s (do this!)
-A ANNOT    Calculate in-target stats using the annotation file (requires -o)
-o PREFIX   Output prefix (note: overlaps with -N)

Input files

Files must be sorted bam files with bai index files available.  Alternatively,
a single pileup file can be supplied.

Output files

Varcalls go to stdout.  Stats go to stdout, or stderr if varcalling too

If an output prefix is used, files are created as follows:
   PREFIX.var       Variant calls in tab delimited 'varcall' format
   PREFIX.eav       Variant calls in tab delimited 'ea-var' format
   PREFIX.vcf       Variant calls, in vcf format
   PREFIX.varsum    Summary of variant calls
   PREFIX.tgt       On-target stats detail
   PREFIX.tgtsum    Summary of on-target stats
   PREFIX.noise     Noise stats detail

Stats Output:

Contains mean, median, quartile information for depth, base quality, read len,
mapping quality, indel levels. Also estimates parameters suitable for
variant calls, and can be passed directly to this program for variant calls
