Usage: fastq-multx <barcodes.fil> <read1.fq> -o r1.%.fq [read2.fq -o r2.%.fq] ...

Output files must contain a '%' sign which is replaced with the barcode id in the barcodes file.

If the first file output is 'n/a' or '/dev/null', it is not written.

Barcodes file looks like this:

<id1> <sequence1>
<id2> <sequence2> ...

Default is to guess the -bol or -eol based on some quick stats (extremely accurate).

If -g is used, and the first file has reads of average length < 10, then it is assumed to
be an index lane, and frequently occuring sequences are calculated.

If -g is supplied with a filename, then all barcodes in that file are tried, and
The groups with the best matches are chosen.

Grouped barcodes file looks like this:

<id1> <sequence1> <group>
<id2> <sequence2> <group>...

Options:

-o FIL1 [FIL2]  Output files (one per input, required)
-g FIL          Determine barcodes from indexed read FIL
-l FIL          Determine barcodes from any read, using FIL as a master list
-b              Force beginning of line
-e              Force end of line
-x              Don't trim barcodes before writing
-n              Don't execute, just print likely barcode list
-v C            Verify that mated id's match up to character C ('/' for illumina)
-m N            Allow up to N mismatches, as long as they are unique
